# Decision-Tree-Algorithm
A basic Decision Tree algorithm implemented from scratch in Python
Decision trees learn rules, as they split data by columns, so as to classify a data point. The python code in this repo, contains a basic implementation using a BTree. The split criterion used here is the Information Gain.
